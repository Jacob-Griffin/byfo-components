## TP Icons

This is a pack of webcomponents so that the svgs can be wrapped/displayed easily.

### Usage

These are webcomponents, so use them the same way as the rest of the stencil library

### Authoring

The components here just have the raw path stuff as the template here. When making edits, just drop the _contents_ of the svg file into the `return()` statement. Just make sure the `<svg>` from your new file is the top level within `return()`
